       <h2>Description:</h2>
       
       <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features 
        chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing 
        ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies are claimed to have 
        originated in the United States in 1938, when Ruth Graves 
        Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar and 
        added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe; however, 
        historical recipes for grated or chopped chocolate cookies 
        exist prior to 1938 by various other authors.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Salted Butter - 8 tablespoons</li>
            <li>White Sugar - 1/2 cup</li>
            <li>Light Brown Sugar - 1/4 cup packed</li>
            <li>Vanilla - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Egg - 1</li>
            <li>All Purpose Flour - 1 1/2 cup</li>
            <li>Baking Soda - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Salt - 1/4 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Chocolate Chips - 3/4 cup</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Soften the butter in the microwave.
            </li>

            <li>
                Combine the butter and the white and brown sugars, beat until smoothly 
                combined. Add in the vanilla and the egg and beat until just 
                incorporated. Be sure not to beat too long.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add in the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until the mixture becomes 
                clumpy. Once the dough is able to be pressed and formed, add in the 
                chocolate chips.
            </li>

            <li>
                Roll the dough into 12 balls and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 
                minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and a light golden color. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Let them cool on the pan for about 30 minutes.
            </li>
         
        </ol>
